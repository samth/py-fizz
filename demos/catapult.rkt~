;TODO:
;  Be able to spawn/swap-to composite objects
;    Do this first.  Needed for cool stuff below (e.g. spawn sparks, blood, etc)
;  Do a demo with something meaningful to swap to:
;    Boxing glove from incredible machine
;    Moving car from not moving car


;NOTES:
;  Can't collide with composite objects -- pinned-motor e.g.


(define b (stick-figure))
(define b2 (gravity '(0 0) (ball)))

                   16)))
