@title{py-fizz}

A high-level language for creating physics simulations and games.  Compiles to Python and runs in the context of Pygame and Pymunk.

There is a high level py-fizz language, used for creating levels and simulations out of pre-built gadgets: e.g. Bowling balls, balloons, motors, etc.  Eg.:

@racketblock[(simulate 
                (wooden-level
                  (bowling-ball)))]

There is a lower-level language for defining your own such gadgets. For example, the bowling-ball gadget might be defined as:

@racketblock[
(define (bowling-ball)
  (mass 100000
        (make-dynamic (h:bitmap "./imgs/bowling-ball.png"))))
]

These docs describe both the high and low level languages.
